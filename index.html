        <p>I'm a Chemical Engineer with experience working in the Oil &amp; Gas industry, a self taught programmer and I love everything related with technology.</p>
        <p>My goal is to eventually blend my experience in Chemical Engineering with  computer programming and change my professional path into something that allows me to mix my career and my love for coding.</p>
