        <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>My name is Fidel, I'm a chemical engineer that really loves programming and everything related with technology. I have a little bit of a background in coding with Python and I'm currently teaching myself web programming.</p>
      <p>My goal is to immerse myself into this new world of computer programming and change my professional path into something that allows me to mix my career and my love for coding.</p> 
      <p>Iâ€™m planning on using this site as a journal to document anything that I find interesting while learning programming languages.</p>
      <p>To accomplish this, am spending a couple hours a day doing the <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">TheOdinProject</a> web programming courses.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my site, and as a token of appreciation here is a little android buddy that I just learned how to code in CSS (Hover your mouse over him!).</p>
